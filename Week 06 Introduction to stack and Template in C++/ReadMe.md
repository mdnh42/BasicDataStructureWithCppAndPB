# Week 06 Stack
## Module 20 Stack
    What is Stack? 
    Stack is a linear data structure that follows a         particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
    push(): When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.

pop(): When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.
isEmpty(): It determines whether the stack is empty or not.
isFull(): It determines whether the stack is full or not.'
peek(): It returns the element at the given position.
count(): It returns the total number of elements available in a stack.
change(): It changes the element at the given position.
display(): It prints all the elements available in the stack.
    - Stack Using Array Theory
    - Two ways implement Static and Dynamic

    - Implementation Array and Linked List
    - Push 
    - Pop
    - Top

    Stack[5]
    1. Top most Element (a[stack_size-1]) O(1)
    2. Delete Top (Pop) o(1)
    3. Add to top (Push) O(1)


## Template in C++ 
    1. Stack Implementation in Template based 
    2. Stack use Sortint 
    3. Stack Reverse
