## Binary Search
    - Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key.
    - If the value of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the search key.
    - Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
    - Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
    - Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is found or the interval is empty.
