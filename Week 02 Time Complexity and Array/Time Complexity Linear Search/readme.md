    - Space Complexity


## Time Complexity
    - Constant Coplexity:
    Statement: Takes 3 int input then find max, min, sum and product and Determine
    TIme Complexity and Space Complexity.
    Time Complexity O(1)
    Space(Memory) Complexity O(1)

    - Variable Complexity
    Statement:Takes N number Array Input and Find them Max, min and Sum. Now Determine the
    Time Complexiy and Space Space Complexity.
    O(n+1+n+1)
    = O(2*n+1)
    = O(n)

    - N Power 2 Complexity
        Statement: Take n Size Array and check them Occur Element using nested Loop;
    Complexity:
    Time Complexity -O(n+ n^2) = O(n^2)
    Space Complexity - O(n)

    - Exponential Complexity
        Take n number of Fibonacci series using recursion.
    Determine Complexity
    Time Complex = O(2^n);
    Space Complex = O(1)

## Linear Search
    Statement:
    Take n and Kth value and find the index, element and similar value;
