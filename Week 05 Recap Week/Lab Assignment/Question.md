Take the Singly linked-list class from Github.            				      15
Link: https://github.com/phitronio/Data-Structure-Batch2/blob/main/Week%204/Module%2013/1.cpp
Add the following functions to the class.
int getLast() -> This function will return the last node of the linked list. If the linked list is empty then return -1.
Sample Input: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5]
Sample Output: 5
double getAverage() -> This function will return the average of all elements in the linked list.
Sample Input: [3, 2, 6, 4, 7]
Sample Output: 4.4

Take the Doubly linked-list class from Github. 				                 15
Link: https://github.com/phitronio/Data-Structure-Batch2/blob/main/Week%204/Module%2014/1.cpp
Add the following functions to the class.
void swap(i , j) -> This function will swap the i-th index and j-th index.
Sample Input: [3, 2, 6, 4, 7], i = 1, j = 4
Sample Output: Doubly Linked list containing the elements [3,7,6,4,2]
void deleteZero() -> This function will delete all the nodes that have data=0.
Sample Input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 5]
Sample Output: Doubly linked list containing the elements [2, 5]
