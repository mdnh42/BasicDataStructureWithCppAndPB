## Non Linear DS and Tree 
    - Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Deque (Linear DS)
    - Tree and Graph Non- Linear 
    
    = Tree 
        - No Cycle
        - Level Infinity 
        

    = Most Popular Binary Tree. 
        - At most 2 Child 
        - Binary Search Tree
        - Heap 
        - AVL Tree
        - Red Black Tree
        - Treap 
        - Splay Tree
        - Segment Tree


    ## Introduction to Graph and Tree

    ## Variations of Binary Tree 
        
        - Full Binary Tree
            = Every nodes has 0 or 2 child
        - Complete Binary Tree
            = Every node has filled up without last level;
        - Perfect Binary Tree 
            = All Level are filled. 


    ## Binary Tree Structure Theory 
        - Declare a Class 
            - id, left node, right node and parent declare
        - Declare Binary_tree Class 
            - Take Root Node
            - Declare Constructor 
            - Declare Inital Value root = NULL;
        - Build Newnode with id; 
            - node* CreateNewnode (int id)
            {
                node* newnode = new node; 
                newnode->id = id; 
                left NULL; 
                Right NULL
                Parent NULL
                return newnode; 
            } 
        - Build Node
            node* allnode[6]; 

            allnode[0].left = value; 
            allnode[0].right = value;
